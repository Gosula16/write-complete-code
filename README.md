# Write Complete Code - Code Generator

This project is a **Code Generator Web Application** that allows users to input a description of the code they want to generate. It leverages **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo** to generate code snippets in multiple programming languages based on the user's input. The application supports generating code in Python, Java, C++, TypeScript, and other languages.

## Features

- **Code Generation**: Users can input a description of the functionality they want, and the app will generate the corresponding code.
- **Language Selection**: Choose the language for code generation (e.g., Python, Java, C++) using a language toggle with icons.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes for a better user experience.
- **API Integration**: Uses OpenAI API to generate code based on user prompts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple form-based interface to interact with the app and get code snippets.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with responsive design for mobile and desktop)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **API**: OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` to securely store the OpenAI API key
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub for repository management
